[The Healthy Way](to make)

# UX:

## Strategy:

### Is the content culturally appropriate?

The times has change, nows days all the peaple are more connected with their bodies, we are living in a new age where fats, carbs, sugar etc are not something strager and this is not just for a better image, this is for a better life.

### Is the content relevant?

This website is aimed for all the people how want to start, continue making his life quality better, for this reason we are going to inclued a user panel where our customer can check their orders and most importat their plans, workout and nutrition ones.

### Can we track a catalogue the content in an intuitive way?

In a simplistic way this website show in home all the services, and a navbar where the client can open their user panel, to control all in just one place.

Using HTML5, django, bootstrap, python, css and js to make this site full responsive and aimed for mobile devices.

### Comprany Goals.

Reach all the peaple interesed in fitness without excluding all the new ones how want to start a life changer, selling product for workout and nutritions suplements.

### Users goals.

The user goal is find the best diet and workout plans in a easy way, buy great gym tools with low prices, check rating of this product.

### What are they doing, but they could be doing better?

We can create an android app to follow or new products, track nutrition and workout plans, and share their goals.

## Scope:

### The main feactures: the possibility of navigating between the following options to find quick as possible the information needed:

A home page showing the main products category: nutrition suplements, gym tools and workout/nutrition plans.
A shop section with the posibility to sort the product by category, price, etc.
A data base of users, products, orders and product with relations.
The possibility to check de details of the products.
An admin panel to edit, delete and add products.
Full mobile device compatibility: The site will be made first thinking for mobiles.

### Desired functions for the future:

Conection to a social media.
Conection to a whatsapp service for contact and the posibility to sell products
Implement multi-language options.
The posibility to make a review about a product.

## Structure

### In this section the basic structure will be outlined, and how the information will be presented.

### What a guest would like to see the first time:

Quick access to the shop
Easy way to buy products
Nice user panel to control all plans

### How I present this information: The best way for me to present the info is to make the web site minimalistic.

- Home:
A navbar with home, shop, profile, in whis page a quick access to a register and login section.

- Shop:
A list of all products.
A menu, with all categories, to filter this products.

- Profile:
For all user a profile panel with the hability to check order history, plans and update data.
