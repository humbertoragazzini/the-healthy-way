[The Healthy Way](https://the-healthy-way.herokuapp.com/).

# UX:

## Strategy:

### Is the content culturally appropriate?

The times has change, Nows days all the people are more connected with their bodies, we are living in a new age where fats, carbs, sugar etc are not something stranger and this is not just for a better image, this is for a better life

### Is the content relevant?

This website is aimed for all the people how want to start, continue making his life quality better, for this reason we are going to include a user panel where our customer can check their orders and most important their plans, workout and nutrition ones. 

### Can we track a catalogue the content in an intuitive way?

In a simplistic way this website show in home all the services, and a navbar where the client can open their user panel, to control all in just one place. 

Using HTML5, django, bootstrap, python, css and js to make this site full responsive and aimed for mobile devices.

### Comprany Goals.

Reach all the people interested in fitness without excluding all the new ones how want to start a life changer, selling product for workout and nutrition's supplements. 

### Users goals.

The user goal is find the best diet and workout plans in a easy way, buy great gym tools with low prices, check rating of this product. 

### What are they doing, but they could be doing better?

We can create an android app to follow or new products, track nutrition and workout plans, and share their goals.

## Scope:

### The main feactures: the possibility of navigating between the following options to find quick as possible the information needed:

A home page showing the main products category: nutrition supplements, gym tools and workout/nutrition plans. 
A shop section with the possibility to sort the product by category, price, etc. 
A data base of users, products, orders and product with relations. 
The possibility to check de details of the products. 
An admin panel to edit, delete and add products. 
Full mobile device compatibility: The site will be made first thinking for mobiles. 

### Desired functions for the future:

Connection to a social media. 
Connection to a whatsapp service for contact and the possibility to sell products Implement multi-language options. 
The possibility to make a review about a product.

## Structure

### In this section the basic structure will be outlined, and how the information will be presented.

### What a guest would like to see the first time:

Quick access to the shop
Easy way to buy products
Nice user panel to control all plans

### How I present this information: The best way for me to present the info is to make the web site minimalistic.

- Home:
A navbar with home, shop, profile, in whis page a quick access to a register and login section.

- Shop:
A list of all products.
A menu, with all categories, to filter this products.

- Profile:
For all user a profile panel with the hability to check order history, plans and update data.

# Deployment

To clone my repository in github

To clone de repository follow this steps:

In my repository you can click clone repository.

## Deployment with gitpod:

* In heroku website we need to create a progress db but before this we going to create an app in the heroku control panel (use your desire plan "free or paid")

* login to heroku with the gitpod terminal: heroku login -i
 Insert username and password from your heroku account.

* with al this done we now can commit and push our project to heroku master or main (git push heroku main)

* check migrations with python3 manage.py showmigrations we should have migrations not applied (this migrations are in the progres db)

* execute the migrations with python3 manage.py migrate

* after this we going to execute this code to copy our data in the db.json: python3 manage.py loaddata db.json

* In the gitpod terminal we initialize heroku with this command:
	heroku git:remote -a heroku_app_name

* Now temporary will going to disable heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app /your horaku app here/

* after this go to heroku appweb and in the deploy setings click in connect to github add the repository name (the repository where you have all the files from this project) and connect

* to test the project we going to generate a secret key for django in miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/ copy this key and paste it in heroku in settings >> confirg vars name: SECRET_KEY // VALUE: your key

* We need to create bucket S3 in AWS to do this follow this:

**The bucket need to have:**
- The bucket need to be public, because will use this bucket for our statics files
- Enable Static Website Hosting
- ACLs enable
- In the permissions tab CORS (edit) and paste this code:
    [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": [
                "Authorization"
            ],
            "AllowedMethods": [
                "GET"
            ],
            "AllowedOrigins": [
                "*"
            ],
            "ExposeHeaders": []
        }
    ]
- In the Policy edit and policy generator: we select ("Type policy":"S3 bucket policy","principal":"*","Actions":"get object") and we paste the ARN
after this we press in generate policy, we are going to copy this but before we are going to change  in the resource key at the end we add /* then save.

- ACL whe select everyone (public access) (we mark "list")

**In the service bar we search IAM**
- we create a group
- Create policy then import manage policy
- Click in amazons3fullaccess and import
- The ARN we copy before we need to added in the policy inside of resource, because is going to be a list, we delete "*" and add:
    [
        "yourARN",
        "yourARN/*"
    ]
next, and review, insert a name and description then create policy
- We attach this policy with the group and create.

**Create user**

- Add user with programmatic access and we add this user to the group when create the user before close, download de CSV file

- Copy this keys in heroku inside the vars option:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY these two codes are inside the CSV file downloaded before.

With this done, we going to online paste our keys from stripe, google email into our heroku panel in vars:
USE_AWS: True
STRIPE_WH_SECRET (webhook): your keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: your key (the secret one in reveal key)
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY: (the public one from the main panel in development in this case)
EMAIL_HOST_USER: your email
EMAIL_HOST_PASS: the code generated by gmail in app (settings)

- Now heroku should take all the static files from aws, and the project is online.
